This example demonstrates:
- Dynamic agent creation using different models
- Team creation and management
- Parallel execution for model comparison
- Result analysis and comparison

2. Create a parallel team with the name "comparison_team".
   It should contain both agents just created.

3. Delegate this task to the team:
   "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in exactly three sentences."

4. Analyze the responses, paying attention to:
   - Differences in explanation style and depth
   - Response time differences
   - Costs
   - Quality of the three-sentence constraint adherence
